Forbidden Buster is a tool designed to automate various techniques in order to bypass HTTP 401 and 403 response codes and gain access to unauthorized areas in the system. **This code is made for security enthusiasts and professionals only. Use it at your own risk.**

## Features

- Probes HTTP 401 and 403 response codes to discover potential bypass techniques.
- Utilizes various methods and headers to test and bypass access controls.
- Customizable through command-line arguments.

### ðŸš€ Updates
- Added API fuzzing methods, which probe for different API versions and also tamper with the data.
- Removed rate limiting feature for now. Better implementation in the future.
  
## Installation & Usage
